# Loan Default Analysis and Dashboard

## Description
This project focused on analyzing bank loan data to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and create interactive dashboards. The primary goal was to uncover patterns related to loan defaults and derive actionable insights. Excel was utilized for the analysis, leveraging advanced techniques such as pivot tables, data filtering, and data visualization to effectively communicate findings.

## Skills and Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables and Filters
- Advanced Data Visualization (Charts)
- Statistical Analysis

## Key Insights
- **Low Loan Default Rate:** Analysis revealed that the occurrence of loan defaults was minimal within the dataset.
- **Minimal Correlation Between Employment Status and Loan Default:** The data suggested no significant relationship between a borrowerâ€™s employment status and the likelihood of loan default.
- **Normal Distribution of Bank Balances:** The distribution of customer bank balances followed a normal (bell-shaped) curve, with the majority of balances ranging between $6,500 and $13,000.
