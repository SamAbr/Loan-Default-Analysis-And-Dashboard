# Loan Default Analysis and Dashboard

## Description
This project analyzes a dataset of bank loans to investigate factors contributing to loan defaults. Using **Microsoft Excel**, a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed, followed by the creation of an interactive **dashboard** to visualize the insights. The analysis aimed to identify potential relationships between variables such as employment status, bank balance, salary, and loan default probability.

## Skills and Tools
- **Microsoft Excel**: Primary tool used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize and analyze data.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Various visualizations including bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts were employed.
- **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics were generated to understand central tendencies and variations in the data.

## Overview and Findings
- **Loan Default Rate**: The overall loan default rate was very low (**3%**), indicating that most loans were successfully repaid.
- **Bank Balance Distribution**: The distribution of customer bank balances followed a normal distribution, with most balances ranging from **$6,500** to **$13,000**.
- **Employment Status vs Loan Default**: No significant relationship was observed between employment status (employed vs. unemployed) and loan defaults. Both categories had a similar likelihood of defaulting.
- **Annual Salary Distribution**: There was considerable variance in annual salaries, with higher salaries generally associated with employed individuals.

## Key Insights
1. **Low Loan Default Rate**: Only **3%** of the total loans were defaulted.
2. **No Strong Link Between Employment Status and Loan Default**: The employment status of individuals showed no significant correlation with loan default rates, implying other factors could be more influential.
3. **Bank Balance Trends**: Bank balances were normally distributed, providing a balanced financial background among loan applicants.
4. **Annual Salary and Default**: Lower salaries were more common among unemployed individuals, but this did not directly correlate with loan default rates.

## Recommendations
- **Targeting High-Risk Groups**: Even though employment status was not a strong predictor of loan defaults, the bank could investigate other factors, such as spending habits or debt-to-income ratios, to refine loan approval strategies.
- **Further Analysis**: Investigate other socioeconomic factors or loan conditions (e.g., loan amount, interest rates) to improve predictions on loan default risk.

## Files Included
- `Bank_Loan_Data.xlsx`: Contains the raw data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard visualization, including statistical summaries and detailed charts.
